	ArrowLISP - An interpreter for Purely Symbolic LISP

	--== Latest News ==--

	The most notable change in this version is the introduction
	of the VERIFY-ARROWS meta function. Arrow verification makes
	sure that N is the normal form of X in X => N. See the
	manual for details.

	Logical falsity is now expressed using :F (truth is T).
	Sorry about this drastic change, but having an extra
	symbol for falsity simplifies the implementation of
	some algorithms significantly.

	Added ArrowLISP Micro KANREN, an implementation of
	KANREN-like logic programming extensions. See src/amk/
	for source code and examples.


	--== What is ArrowLISP? ==--

	ArrowLISP is an interpreter for a purely symbolic,
	side effect-free, lexically scoped dialect of LISP.
	It may be considered an implementation of pure LISP
	plus global definitions.


	--== Installation ==--

	The interpreter is written in ANSI C (C89) and LISP.
	It should compile without any modifications on a
	variety of systems including *BSD, Linux, Plan 9
	(using APE), and W*ndows via MinGW or Cygwin.

	On a typical post-1990 Unix system typing

	make
	su
	make install
	exit

	should work fine.


	--== Getting Started ==--

	After installing ArrowLISP, type

	alisp

	to launch the interpreter.

	Typing

	man 7 alisp

	will produce the alisp(7) man page.

	The Reference Manual can be found in the file

	/usr/local/share/doc/alisp/alisp.txt

	(unless you are using a different PREFIX).
